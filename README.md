## How To Get A Skin Hash
To get a skin hash, goto [NameMC's Skin Tab](https://namemc.com/minecraft-skins), and find a skin you like the look of. Click on the associated link and copy the piece of text after '/skin/' in the link.
For example, if my skin's link was [https://namemc.com/skin/c39310814f4bde6f](https://namemc.com/skin/c39310814f4bde6f), my Skin hash would be c39310814f4bde6f.
