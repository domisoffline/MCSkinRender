# MCSkinRender

The Easiest Minecraft Skin Renderer!

## How To Get A Skin Hash

To get a Skin Hash, goto [NameMC's Skin Tab](https://namemc.com/minecraft-skins), and find a skin you like the look of. Click on the associated link and copy the piece of text after '/skin/' in the link.
For example, if my skin's link was [https://namemc.com/skin/c39310814f4bde6f](https://namemc.com/skin/c39310814f4bde6f), my Skin hash would be 'c39310814f4bde6f' (without the quotes).

## How To Get A Cape Hash

Getting a Cape Hash is done in very much the same way as getting a Skin Hash, but by navigating to the [NameMC Cape Tab](https://namemc.com/Capes) instead. Once there, click on the cape you would like to add to a skin. Then, to grab the hash, simply copy the piece of text after '/cape/'. So if my cape's link was [https://namemc.com/cape/1981aad373fa9754](https://namemc.com/cape/1981aad373fa9754), my Cape Hash would be '1981aad373fa9754' (without the quotes).

## How Renders Are Saved

Renders are saved in the 'Renders' folder, which is located in the root directory of the program. If for some reason the Renders folder does not exist, the program will create it upon finishing a succesful render. Renders are named in the following format:

`<Skin Hash>_<Cape Hash>.png`

or if your render has no cape:

`<Skin Hash>.png`
