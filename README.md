## How To Get A Skin Hash
To get a Skin Hash, goto [NameMC's Skin Tab](https://namemc.com/minecraft-skins), and find a skin you like the look of. Click on the associated link and copy the piece of text after '/skin/' in the link.
For example, if my skin's link was [https://namemc.com/skin/c39310814f4bde6f](https://namemc.com/skin/c39310814f4bde6f), my Skin hash would be c39310814f4bde6f.

## How To Get A Cape Hash
Getting a Cape Hash is done in very much the same way as getting a Skin Hash, but by navigating to the [NameMC Cape Tab](https://namemc.com/Capes) instead. Once there, click on the cape you would like to add to a skin. Then, to grab the hash, simply copy the piece of text after '/cape/'. So if my cape's link was [https://namemc.com/cape/1981aad373fa9754](https://namemc.com/cape/1981aad373fa9754), my Cape Hash would be 1981aad373fa9754.
